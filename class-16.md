## Serverless <br>

*What is serverless?* Cloud computing application development model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure<br>
-Serverless doesn't mean no servers, it means the servers dont need to be maintained in anyway<br>
Serverless is more than just FaaS (Function as a service): Cloud cloud computing service that enables developers to run code or containers in response to specific events or requests, without specifying or managing the infrastructure required to run to code<br>
-Serverless databases and storage: <br>
Event streaming and messaging<br>
API gateways<br>
*Serverless vs. PaaS, containers, and VMs*<br>
-Provisioning time<br>
-Administrative burden<br>
-Maintenance<br>
-Scaling<br>
-Statelessness<br>
-Resource utilization<br>
Billing granularity and savings<br>
*Serverless, Kubernetes and Knative*  open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, management and scaling of containers. Knative provides a serverless framework for Kubernetes<br>
Pros and cons of serverless<br>
*Pros*<br>
-Improved developer productivity<br>
-Pay for execution only<br>
-Develop in any language<br>
-Streamlined development/DevOps cycles<br>
-Cost-effective performance<br>
-Usage visibility<br>
*Cons*<br>
-Unacceptable latency for certain applications<br>
-Higher costs for stable or predictable workloads<br>
-Monitoring and debugging issues<br>
-Vendor lock-in<br>
*Use cases for serverless*<br>
