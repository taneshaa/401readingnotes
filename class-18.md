#### Encryption, decryption, and cracking <br>
-Cearsar cipher simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount<br>
*Decrypting a message*<br>
example<br>
message to a comrade:<br>
EHZDUH EUXWXV<br>
uses this substitution table, where the alphabet is shifted by 3<br>
A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z<br>
D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	A	B	C<br>
"E" was shifted by 3 from "B", the second letter "H" was shifted by 3 from "E", etc<br>
result<br>
BEWARE BRUTUS<br>
*Cracking the cipher*<br>
Three main techniques<br>
-Frequency analysis: The characters frequencies can be analyzed in the message to be able to identify the most likely first letter, then it can narrow down the possible shift amounts based on that<br>
-Known plaintext<br>
-Brute force<br>
<br>
