O(1): algorithm that will grow to the size of the input data<br>
O(n): algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set<br>
O(n2): algorithm performance is directly equal to the input data<br>
O(2^n): algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set<br>
