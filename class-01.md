Big O: algorithm that will always execute at the same time<br>
O(1): algorithm that will grow to the size of the input data<br>
O(n): algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set<br>
O(n2): algorithm performance is directly equal to the input data<br>
O(2^n): algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set<br>

Names & Values in Python: <br>

Names refer to values (variables) <br>
Many names can refer to one value <br>
Names are reassigned independently <br>
x = 23 ... y = x ... x = 12 ... means y is still 23 while x is 12 now <br>

Values live until no references exist <br>
Assignment never copies data <br>

Immutable values can't alias <br>
Mutable values can alias <br>

References can be more than just names <br>
Lots of things are references <br>

Object attributes <br>
list elements <br>
dict values and keys <br>
anything to the left side of an assignment <br>
Lots of things are also assignments <br>

Python is dynamically typed <br>
names have no types associated with them but they have scope <br>
values have no scope but do have a type <br>
