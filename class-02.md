### Testing and Modules <br>
Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.<br>
### TDD With Python<br>
with TDD (Test Driven Development) we need to think about tests first. <br>
Arrange- Data organization for code! <br>
Act- Execute tested code!<br>
Assert- Double check code!<br>
Babysteps and think "what is the smaller test that we can do against a function (method/class) that will return ___?"<br>
### Recursion<br>
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc. A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems. Many more recursive calls can be generated as and when required. It is essential to know that we should provide a certain case in order to terminate this recursion process. So we can say that every time the function calls itself with a simpler version of the original problem.
