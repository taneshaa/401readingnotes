Please give one example from your past school experiences where you had a FIXED mindset--what happened and how did you react?
I originally didn’t think teachers really cared about students. Almost all of my teachers growing up didn’t really care about students who struggled the most. I was usually one of them. <br>



Re-write that experience into a growth mindset...in other words, if you know then what you know now, how would you have changed your reaction to the experience?
I sent myself to an intense program and had some of the most supportive instructors of my life. It changed my relationships with my really good teachers in high school as I finished to graduate. I wouldn’t waste time going back and having another conversation with the instructors who belittled me, ignored me and put me down- growth is just moving onto better people. <br>



Briefly discuss how you will use a growth mindset going forward and give a specific example (i.e., if you are worried about a class, how will you approach it using a growth mindset?).
I email when I need help, am behind, or somethings wrong/happened in my life. I do whatever I can to get things done.  There’s nothing else that really can be done.<br>
