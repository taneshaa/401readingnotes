### What Is SSH: Understanding Encryption, Ports and Connection<br>
-Secure Shell Protocol<br>
-Jargon for anything cyber security related<br>
-Remote administration protocol that allows users to access, control, and modify their remote servers over the internet<br>
-Created as a secure replacement for the unencrypted Telnet<br>
-Uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that all communication to and from the remote server happens in an encrypted manner<br>
-Provides a way to authenticate remote users by transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the client<br>
#### Different Encryption Techniques<br>
1. Symmetrical encryption<br>
-a secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message by both the client and the host<br>
2. Asymmetrical encryption<br>
-Uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption kown as the public key and private key<br>
3. Hashing<br>
-Another form of cryptography used in Secure Shell Connections<br>
