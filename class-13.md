Scikit-learn: contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction<br>
*What is scikit-learn?* A powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction<br>

*Training and validation data sets* You wont implement linear regression on the whole data set in practice. The data sets will need to be split into training and test data sets. Then you can train your model on training data and see how it performs on test data.<br>
*Residual Plots* Can assist with visualizing errors in your data. If it's correct then your data should be randomly scattered around line zero. If you see structure in your data, that means your model is not capturing some thing.<br>
