### Pandas in 10
article: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html <br>

Creating a Series by passing a list of values, letting pandas create a default integer index<br>
There's only one dtype per column in Pandas dataframes<br>
The value np.nan is primarily used in Panda to represent missing data<br>
Pandas allows easily combining together Series and DataFrame objects with various kinds of set logic for the indexes and relational algebra functionality in the case of join / merge-type operations<br>
Pandas has basic, powerful, and efficient functionality for performing resampling operations during frequency conversion (e.g., converting secondly data into 5-minutely data)
Pandas includes categorical data in a DataFrame<br>
You can change/add/delete the index on a specified axis by reindexing<br>
DataFrame.to_numpy() gives a NumPy representation of the underlying data<br>
hen you call DataFrame.to_numpy(), pandas will find the NumPy dtype that can hold all of the dtypes in the DataFrame<br>
Operations in general exclude missing data<br>
