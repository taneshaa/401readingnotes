article: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html <br>

Creating a Series by passing a list of values, letting pandas create a default integer index<br>
Pandas DataFrames have one dtype per column<br>
Pandas primarily uses the value np.nan to represent missing data<br>
Pandas provides various facilities for easily combining together Series and DataFrame objects with various kinds of set logic for the indexes and relational algebra functionality in the case of join / merge-type operations<br>
Pandas has simple, powerful, and efficient functionality for performing resampling operations during frequency conversion (e.g., converting secondly data into 5-minutely data)
Pandas can include categorical data in a DataFrame<br>
Reindexing allows you to change/add/delete the index on a specified axis<br>
DataFrame.to_numpy() gives a NumPy representation of the underlying data<br>
hen you call DataFrame.to_numpy(), pandas will find the NumPy dtype that can hold all of the dtypes in the DataFrame<br>
Operations in general exclude missing data<br>
